Coastal cities are at particular risk due to rising sea levels.\nExpert: The report emphasizes that immediate action is needed to prevent catastrophic consequences. We need to significantly reduce carbon emissions and transition to renewable energy sources.\nExpert: If global temperatures increase by more than 1.5°C, we could face irreversible damage to ecosystems, agriculture, and water supply. It will have a devastating impact on biodiversity as well.\nReporter: The IPCC also stresses the importance of individual action. Governments must set stronger policies, but individuals can help by reducing waste, conserving water, and supporting green initiatives.\nExpert: It's not just about the big changes; small actions like using public transportation, reducing meat consumption, and recycling can collectively make a significant difference.\nReporter: With the next UN Climate Summit coming up next month, world leaders will need to prioritize climate action.
